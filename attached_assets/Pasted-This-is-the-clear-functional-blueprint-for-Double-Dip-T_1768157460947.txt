This is the clear, functional blueprint for Double Dip.

The Feature List

1. Private Account & Pairing

Personal Profiles: Each player creates an individual account to keep their answers private.

One-to-One Linking: A user generates a unique invite link. Once the partner joins, the pair is "locked" together.

Duo-Only Access: The game is strictly for two people. No other users can view or join an established pair's session.

2. AI Daily Question Engine

Daily Refresh: Every 24 hours, the AI generates 5 new questions.

Standard Categories:

The Deep End: Emotional and meaningful questions.

The Danger Zone: Playful debates and spicy "hot takes."

The Daily Loop: Routine, habits, and lifestyle questions.

The Rewind: Relationship history and memories.

The Glitch: Bizarre and "unhinged" hypothetical scenarios.

3. The Double-Blind Reveal

Hidden Answers: You cannot see your partner’s answer until you have submitted your own.

Simultaneous Unveiling: Once both partners hit "Submit," the answers are revealed to both players at the same time.

4. The Dip Vault (History Archive)

Permanent Records: Every shared answer is automatically saved into a chronological timeline.

Category Filtering: Players can sort their history to view only specific categories (e.g., see every "Danger Zone" answer from the last month).

Search Function: A search bar to find past answers using keywords.

5. Engagement & Scoring

The Ripeness Streak: Tracks how many consecutive days the couple has completed their daily set.

The Nudge: A "Reminder" button to alert a partner who hasn't answered yet.

Reactions: After a reveal, players can add a reaction (emoji or heart) to their partner's answer.

The Workflow

Step 1: The Setup

User A signs up and sends an invite link to User B.

User B accepts, and the two accounts are permanently linked.

Step 2: The Daily Drop

At midnight, the AI generates 5 new questions for the couple.

Both partners receive a notification that "The Daily Dip" is ready.

Step 3: Answering

Partner A opens the app and types their responses. They see a "Locked" status for Partner B’s side.

Partner B opens the app later and types their responses. They see that Partner A has already finished.

Step 4: The Reveal

The moment Partner B hits "Submit," the privacy shields disappear for both players.

Both partners can now see their answers side-by-side.

Step 5: Archiving

The answers move from the home screen to "The Vault."

The couple's "Streak" count increases by one.

Step 6: Reviewing

At any time, either partner can enter "The Vault" to scroll through their history or look back at a specific memory from weeks or months ago.
