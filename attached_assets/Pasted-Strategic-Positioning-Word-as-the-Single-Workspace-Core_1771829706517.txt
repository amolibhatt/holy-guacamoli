Strategic Positioning: Word as the Single Workspace

Core Decision

Mitigate Risk is a Word-centric experience.

Regardless of where the feature is launched from, Mitigate Risk is reviewed and acted on only within Microsoft Word.

Mitigate Risk runs as a skill within Lito Word (the AI experience embedded in Word).

Rationale

Microsoft Word is the system of record for legal negotiation.

Track Changes is the shared, legally accepted language between counterparties.

Lito Web and Lito Outlook do not support document modification, making them unsuitable as clause-level workspaces.

Only Word guarantees fidelity of:

numbering,

cross-references,

tables,

headings and formatting.

Lawyers expect to reason about risk while viewing the exact clause in full document context.

Anchoring Mitigate Risk in Word:

eliminates ambiguity about document versions,

reduces context switching,

establishes a single, consistent mental model.

Document Eligibility Model

Eligible Document

Mitigate Risk is available only when the currently open Microsoft Word document:

is editable, and

contains unresolved tracked changes.

Tracked changes may originate from any source, including:

Litera Compare,

third-party comparison tools,

manual edits created directly in Word.

Important

Mitigate Risk does not depend on the provenance of redlines.

Eligibility is based solely on presence and unresolved state of tracked changes.

Ineligible Document

Mitigate Risk must not be available for:

clean documents (no tracked changes),

documents where all tracked changes are already resolved,

read-only documents,

password-protected documents.

These restrictions prevent users from attempting Mitigate Risk in states where it cannot operate safely or meaningfully.

Workflows

Primary Workflow: Active Word Document

This is the core and intended experience.
All other workflows exist only to bring the user into this state.

State

A redlined document is open in Microsoft Word.

The Lito Word add-in is loaded.

Availability Gate

When a document is opened, Lito for Word evaluates:

whether unresolved tracked changes exist, and

whether the document is editable.

If both conditions are true:

the Mitigate Risk entry point is shown in Lito Word.

If either condition is false:

Mitigate Risk is hidden.

User Feedback (When Ineligible)

If the user attempts to invoke Mitigate Risk via prompt or navigation while the document is ineligible, Lito displays:

“This document must contain tracked changes for Mitigate Risk to run.”

Reasoning

Hiding the feature by default avoids confusion and misuse.

Explicit feedback on attempted access educates the user without exposing unsafe states.

Launch from Lito Web or Lito Outlook

State

The user is in Lito Web or Lito Outlook.

The user wants to use Mitigate Risk on a document.

Behavior

Mitigate Risk is not executed in Lito Web or Lito Outlook.

In Lito Web:

results may be viewed in a read-only manner.

In Lito Outlook:

the Mitigate Risk skill card is displayed,

execution does not occur in Outlook.

In both cases, the user is prompted to open the redlined document in Microsoft Word.

Upon Confirmation

the redlined document opens in Microsoft Word,

the Lito Word add-in launches automatically,

the user is taken directly into the Mitigate Risk experience within Lito Word,

document eligibility rules are evaluated before the skill becomes active.

Reasoning

Lito Web and Outlook act as launch points, not workspaces.

Clause-level risk review requires:

tracked changes,

structural context,

authoritative document state,
which only Word provides.

Clean Document Opened in Word

Behavior

Mitigate Risk is not shown.

If the user attempts to access it:

Lito explains that a redline is required,

the user is guided to generate a comparison.

Uploaded Redline While a Clean Word Document Is Open

Behavior

Mitigate Risk is not run against the clean document.

The user is guided to open the redlined document in Word.

Once the redlined document is open and eligible:

the Primary Workflow applies,

Mitigate Risk becomes available.

This ensures Mitigate Risk always operates on the correct document and version.

Mitigate Risk Review Experience

Change Presentation

Changes are listed in document order (start → end).

Only unresolved tracked changes are shown.

Each change includes:

type of change (add / delete / modify),

affected section or clause reference,

risk level (High / Medium / Low),

explanation of why the change is risky.

Document Synchronization

Selecting a risk scrolls the Word document to the relevant clause.

The document remains the primary visual anchor at all times.

This removes ambiguity about what text is under discussion.

Mitigation & Revision Model

Revise (Copy–Paste Model)

Suggested revised language is displayed in the panel.

The user copies and pastes the text into the document.

The user may edit or adapt the language freely.

Rationale

Lawyers frequently tweak language.

Automatic insertion risks:

incorrect placement,

overwriting content,

structural breakage.

Copy–paste ensures:

intent,

precision,

user control.

Edge Case Handling

Partially resolved redlines → show unresolved changes only

Track Changes disabled mid-session → pause interaction

Formatting-only changes → allowed

Tables, headers, footers → supported only where APIs allow

Password-protected documents → Mitigate Risk unavailable

Large documents → progressive rendering

Structural Integrity Requirements

Mitigate Risk must never cause:

broken numbering,

lost defined terms,

invalid cross-references,

corrupted tables or headings.

If safety cannot be guaranteed, the feature must not proceed.

Out of Scope

Automatic insertion of text

Accept / Reject automation

Bulk operations

Execution outside Microsoft Wor
