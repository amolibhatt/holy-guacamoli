The Core Concept: What is PSYOPS about?
The game is about Information Warfare. You are given a real, bizarre fact that has been "Redacted" (a word is missing). Your job is to manufacture a lie so believable that your friends vote for it instead of the truth.
The Slogan: Manufacture the lie. Redact the truth. Control the room.
1. The Gameplay Workflow (Simple Terms)
Phase 1: The Briefing (Host Screen)
The big screen shows a "Redacted Fact."
Example: "In the 18th century, King George I of England officially hired a man to [REDACTED] for the Royal Court."
Phase 2: The Disinformation (Player Phones)
Every player types a "Believable Lie" on their phone to fill that blank.
Note: The "Amoli Bot" also submits one highly intelligent lie to mess with everyone.
Phase 3: The Deep State (The Vote)
The big screen shows all the players' lies + the Amoli Bot lie + the 1 actual truth, all mixed up.
Everyone uses their phone to pick the one they think is the truth.
Rule: You cannot vote for your own lie.
Phase 4: The Aftermath (The Reveal)
The big screen reveals who wrote what.
+10 points if you find the Truth.
+5 points for every friend you "Gaslit" into picking your lie.
-10 points if you were dumb enough to pick the Amoli Bot’s lie.
2. The Category List (The "Intelligence Folders")
For your Excel sheet, here are 5 "Amoli-Approved" categories for PSYOPS.
Board	Category	Rule
Board 4	Redacted History	Weird things humans actually did in the past.
Board 4	Legal Leaks	Strange laws that are technically still real.
Board 4	Corporate Scams	Bizarre facts about famous brands.
Board 4	Biological Bugs	Facts about nature that sound like glitches.
Board 4	Celebrity Secrets	Unhinged (but true) facts about famous people.
3. The Shuffle & Memory Logic (Foolproof)
To keep the game from getting boring, the Shuffle Logic for PSYOPS works like this:
The Pool: It pulls from your 5 "Intelligence Folders" (Categories).
The Meld: It merges Global Facts with Personal Facts (if the Admin uploaded their own "Redacted" clues).
Memory: Once a "Fact" has been played, it is added to the played_history and won't show up again for the rest of the night.
