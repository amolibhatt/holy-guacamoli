System Workflows & Logic (Instructions for Replit)
1. The "Coming Soon" Toggle Logic

Database Field: games.is_active (Boolean).

Frontend Logic:

if (is_active === true): Render high-energy "PLAY NOW" card with full navigation.

if (is_active === false): Render greyed-out "COMING SOON" card; disable click events.

Super Admin Control: A dashboard with checkboxes for every game ID to flip this boolean.

2. Multi-Tenancy (Data Privacy) Logic

Database Association: Every User and Group Board must have a tenant_id.

Data Isolation:

Super Admin: Query returns SELECT * FROM table.

Admin: Query returns SELECT * FROM table WHERE tenant_id = current_admin_id.

Sharing: If tenant_id is NULL or 'GLOBAL', it appears for everyone.

3. The "Buzzkill" Management Workflow

Creation:

Super Admin creates a "Master Pack" (Visible to all).

Admin creates a "Custom Pack" (Visible only to their room/tenant).

Game Start: The Admin selects which packs to include in the current 5x5 grid session.

4. The "Double Dip" Management Workflow

AI Prompting: Super Admin manages the "System Prompt" for OpenAI to ensure the daily questions match the Amoli brand.

Stats Tracking: Super Admin sees global average compatibility; Admin sees which couples in their tenant group are most "Synced."

Prompt to give Replit Agent:

"Build a Multi-Tenant Admin System for the Holy GuacAmoli! app using the following logic:

Authentication: Create a 'Super Admin' role (Unique to Amoli) and an 'Admin' role (for Tenants/Hosts).

Global Game Control: Implement a 'Game Manager' for Super Admin to toggle specific game modes (e.g., Double Dip, Buzzkill) between 'Active' and 'Coming Soon'. This must reflect immediately on the public homepage.

The Master Bank: Super Admin can manage a global library of boards/questions.

Tenant Isolation: Admins should have a dashboard where they see ONLY their specific users and stats. Admins can create their own private 'Buzzkill' boards that aren't visible to the public or other tenants.

Analytics: Super Admin sees a global dashboard (total users/global trends). Admin sees a tenant dashboard (group leaderboards/member activity).

Database: Ensure all questions, users, and scores are linked to a tenant_id (or null for Global) to maintain strict data separation."

Amoli, this covers the entire "Amoli-Control" structure. It keeps the public app simple and fun while giving you the power to manage everything behind the scenes! Ready to start the build?
